<p>
	As a developer, it's rare to use bitwise operators.
	But sometimes it's useful to know how to use them.
	There are many articles written about bitwise operators, so I will not explain them in detail.
	Instead of that, I will show you some examples of using bitwise operators.

	Practical use case

<system-anchor heading='h3'>
	1. XOR
</system-anchor>
At leetcode, there is a problem called <system-inline-link url='https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/'>single number</system-inline-link>.

<system-blockquote>
	Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
	<p class='mt-5'>Example:</p>
	<p><span class='font-bold'>Input:</span> nums = [2,2,1]</p>
	<p><span class='font-bold'>Output:</span> 1</p>
</system-blockquote>

We can solve this problem by using XOR operator.

<system-codeblock lang='py' filename='leetcode_single_number.py'>
def single_number(nums):
	res = 0
		for i in nums:
			res ^= i
	return res
</system-codeblock>

<system-info>
	<p>
		a ^ a = 0
	</p>
	<p>
		a ^ 0 = a
	</p>
</system-info>

<system-anchor heading='h3'>
	2. Boolean flags
</system-anchor>

<system-codeblock lang='py' library='python >=v3.6' filename='permission.py'>
from enum import Flag, auto


class Permission(Flag):
	NONE = 0
	READ = auto()
	EXECUTE = auto()
	DELETE = auto()


# Initialize the permission
permission = Permission.NONE

# Set the READ permission
permission |= Permission.READ  # permission = Permission.READ

# Set the EXECUTE permission
permission |= Permission.EXECUTE  # permission = Permission.EXECUTE|READ

# Set the DELETE permission
permission |= Permission.DELETE  # permission = Permission.DELETE|EXECUTE|READ

# Check if the READ permission is set
permission & Permission.READ == Permission.READ  # True

# Disable the READ permission
permission ^= Permission.READ  # permission = Permission.DELETE|EXECUTE

permission & Permission.READ == Permission.READ  # False
</system-codeblock>

<p>
	There are many other use cases of bitwise operators. But for practical use cases, I think these two are enough - at least for me. üòÅ
